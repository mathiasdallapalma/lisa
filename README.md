LiSA (Library for Static Analysis) aims to ease the creation and implementation of static analyzers based on the Abstract Interpretation theory.
LiSA provides an analysis engine that works on a generic and extensible control flow graph representation of the program to analyze. Abstract interpreters in LiSA are built 
for analyzing such representation, providing a unique analysis infrastructure for all the analyzers that will rely on it.

Building an analyzer upon LiSA boils down to writing a parser for the language that one aims to analyze, translating the source code or the compiled code towards 
the control flow graph representation of LiSA. Then, simple checks iterating over the results provided by the semantic analyses of LiSA can be easily defined to translate 
semantic information into warnings that can be of value for the final user.

### Snapshots

The snapshot of the last commit of the `master` branch is always available on [GitHub Packages](https://github.com/orgs/lisa-analyzer/packages?repo_name=lisa). Be aware that you will need a personal access token to use packages as server for resolving dependencies. You can refer to the official GitHub guide for [Maven](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-apache-maven-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages) or [Gradle](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-gradle-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages) for more information.

### Apron Configuration

Apron is a separate tool that needs to be installed separately for Lisa to recognize it. Here's how to set it up:

1. Set the Environment Variable:

You'll need to define an environment variable called **APRON_PATH** that points to the root directory where Apron is installed.

There are two ways to do this:

* a) Using the Command Line:

  Open a terminal window and type the following command, replacing <path_to_apron> with the actual location of your Apron installation:

  `export APRON_PATH=<path_to_apron>`

* b) Using an IDE:

  If you're using an IDE like IntelliJ IDEA, you can set environment variables within the IDE itself. Here's a general guideline (consult your IDE's documentation for specific instructions):

  Go to Run > Edit Configurations (or Settings depending on your IDE).\
  Look for a section related to Run Configurations or Environment Variables.\
  Add a new variable named **APRON_PATH** and set its value to the path of your Apron installation.

Depending on your operating system, you might also need to set the paths for the dipendencies that Apron relies on. A quick solution for experienced Linux users is to add the directories containing the required libraries to the `/etc/ld.so.conf` file. This allows the system linker to search for libraries in those locations.

2. Building the Project:

Once the environment variable is set, you can build your project as usual.
